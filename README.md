# 2021 Engineering Conferences
A list of 2021 conferences.
A list of [2020 conferences](https://github.com/ryanburgess/2020-conferences).

_**You can also add all conferences directly into your calendar by importing the `.ics` file into Google Calendar etc.**_

_**The `.ics` file can be downloaded [here](https://rawgit.com/ryanburgess/2019-conferences/master/2019-conferences.ics), but it's recommended to add it via URL (if your client supports that). Thus, you will dynamically get all updates.**_
